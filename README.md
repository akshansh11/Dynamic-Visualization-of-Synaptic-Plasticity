# Dynamic-Visualization-of-Synaptic-Plasticity

This Streamlit-based app dynamically visualizes key concepts of synaptic plasticity, such as Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-Term Depression (LTD), through interactive plots. The app allows users to:

1. Control the input intensity using a slider to observe its effect on synaptic responses:

2. Mean Coupling (K) representing the strength of the synaptic connections.
Response curves (R) showing both STDP-based (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) and fixed responses.
Visualize synaptic connectivity through a heatmap of randomly generated synaptic weights between pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons. Users can adjust the matrix size to explore different network configurations.

The app provides an intuitive interface for understanding how synaptic strength changes with varying inputs and how connections between neurons may evolve, making it a helpful tool for both learning and research on neural dynamics.
